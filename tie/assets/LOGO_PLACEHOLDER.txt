IMPORTANT: Place your Mile Medical logo file here

Filename: logo-white.png
Recommended specs:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Size: 200x200px (will be scaled automatically)
- Color: White or light colored logo for dark background
- Quality: High resolution for crisp display

The logo will be displayed in the sidebar header with:
- Width: 40px (auto-scaled)
- Rounded corners
- Subtle background glow
- White background with 5% opacity

If you don't have the logo file yet, you can:
1. Create a temporary placeholder logo
2. Use a text-based logo temporarily
3. Or leave the img element in the HTML - it will gracefully fail without breaking the layout
